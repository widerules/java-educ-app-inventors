The community project is designed to offer Java education for App Inventors who have grasped the concept of programming - design and code logic.

The plan is to introduce Java programming language to new programmers by translating their source in App Inventor to Java code. The early training is to learn how to translate by hand the source without any assistance of using specialized tools.

The wiki here will provide tutorials explaining how to translate source in App Inventor to Java code and use App Inventor components library known as JavaBridge. The tutorials will be written in either outline or long form.

The specialized tools will be developed here for the programmers to translate and export the source to Eclipse IDE in order to download an APK file into phone/tablet devices and run the app. The executable tools will be provided in the Downloads list here. The list also includes examples used for the tutorials.

Open source for all tools will be provided in the Mercurial source repository.

For those who have considerable knowledge of Java programming and want to share their experience, please email kawageo at gmail dot com. Thank you.
